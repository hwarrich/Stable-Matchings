# Stable Matchings
This program uses the **McVitie-Wilson Algorithm** to compute a stable matching between
hospitals and residents. It is written in Java.

Compiling and running the program:

`javac *.java`

`java SMTester.java`

This project was completed as part of an intro to computer science class that I was a TA for.
